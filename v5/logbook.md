# Logbook for v5

I think I should do essentially what I had before but have 2 different shoes for minimum bets and kelly bets

rentShoes.txt - sum of bets for true 0 or less
advantageShoes.txt - sum of bets for advantage counts
countStats.txt - outcome distribution at each non-negative count: total,-8,-7,-6,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,-0.5,0,1,1.5,2,3,4,5,6,7,8; 20 total values
make it so you can figure out the standard deviation and edge at each count to get kelly factor
